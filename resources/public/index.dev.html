      This is the game Breakout built with ClojureScript and Reagent. The repo is <a href="https://github.com/city41/reagent-breakout">here.</a> It
      was derived from the <a href="http://jsbreakouts.org">Breakouts Project</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      So far it does not work with mobile devices and there are some other <a href="https://github.com/city41/reagent-breakout/issues">issues</a>.
