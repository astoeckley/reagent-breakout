      This is the game Breakout built with ClojureScript and Reagent. The repo is <a href="https://github.com/city41/reagent-breakout">here.</a> It
      was based on the <a href="http://www.jsbreakouts.org">Breakouts Project</a>.

      So far it does not work with mobile devices, there is no sound and hit detection can be a little wonky.
